*** This Stuff is Real
Data Breaches are Real. 
 
The last 12 months have seen significant breaches.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Hardly necessary to start with this.

*** We're Failing
/"Despite being the most at-risk and perpetually breached critical infrastructure sector in the Nation, virtually all health sector organizations refuse to evolve their layered security to combat a hyper evolving threat landscape..."/ 

*** We're Failing 
/"As a result, when a healthcare system is breached and patient records are stolen, the entire brutal impact of the incident that resulted from poor cybersecurity on behalf of the healthcare organization is forced onto the shoulders of the victim to deal with for the rest of their life."/

- 2016, Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology (ICIT)

*** Safety vs. Freedom 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
We begin the discussion with some fundamental corollaries. Let us recognize:

#+END_NOTES

Every discussion of security eventually boils down to balance between security and freedom.

Each product or effort solidifies limits at the expense of freedoms and enables freedoms at the expense of limits. 

*(Excluding mistakes and bad design)*

*** The Structure is Changing   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
On top of the complexities of sound and appropriate security design...
#+END_NOTES

From _Monolith to Microservice_.

This is affecting primary security practices.

*** What is a Monolith?
A Monolithic Architecture is one where functionally separate software services are interwoven.

In the past the practice was to buy hardware and run the full software stack on those machines.

In many cases we've moved services to the cloud, but frequently the architecture is still monolithic.
 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Monolith: the front end, back end database, logic, interfaces with other functions. All local.
#+END_NOTES

*** What are Microservices?
