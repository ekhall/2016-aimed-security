<h3 id="org5bf464a">Safety vs. Freedom</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We begin the discussion with some fundamental corollaries. Let us recognize:
</p>

<p>
With human nature, the tendency is to think that if we keep our records in a locked box inside the firewalls of our hospital or medical practice, we're safe. That may not be - the security surface area of tens of thousands of individual EHRs rely on a wide range of quality in security best practices. They rely on each individual "pot" of data being small enough to be "not worth it".
</p>

</aside>

<p>
<i>(Excluding mistakes and bad design&#x2026;)</i>
</p>

<p>
Every discussion of security eventually boils down to balance between security and freedom.
</p>

<p>
Each product or effort solidifies limits at the expense of freedoms and enables freedoms at the expense of limits. 
</p>

<p>
Tendency in healthcare is to bias that lean towards security and limits.

<h3 id="orgd2ec687">The Structure is Changing</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
On top of the complexities of sound and appropriate security design&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
When we think about building our systems, instead of putting all features of a system into a process, we should instead break it apart into separate pieces that collaborate with each other. 
</p>

</aside>

<p>
From <span class="underline">Monolith to Microservice</span>.
</p>

<p>
As complexity increases, the benefits of moving left to right increase.
</p>

<p>
This change is fundamentally affecting primary security practices.

<section id="slide-orgaece8cf">
<h3 id="orgaece8cf">What is a Monolith?</h3>
<p>
A <span class="underline">Monolithic Architecture</span> is one where <b>functionally separate software services are interwoven</b>.
</p>

<p>
In the Past: Local Hardware.
</p>

<p>
Today: More and more moved to cloud, frequently still monolithic. 
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Monolith: the front end, back end database, logic, interfaces with other functions. All local.

<div class="figure">

<p>
From Martin Fowler
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The choice between the two is a place with two obvious end-points and some grey in between.
</p>

<p>
For 5 people, productivity better with monolith. For 500 people, likely microservice approach.
</p>

<p>
But I would argue there's more at stake here in this graph than developer productivity. Inside the meaning of this graph is the facility of the system to being understood. And the better something is understood, the better is can be secured.

<h3 id="org326dd30">What are Microservices?</h3>
<ul>
<li>"New" way to think about structuring applications.</li>
<li><span class="underline">Moves infrastructure up to the application level.</span>
<ul>
<li>Can do infrastructure insertion.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Single application as a suite of small services
<ul>
<li>Each in its own process</li>
<li>Communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often via HTTP network API</li>
<li>Built around business capabilities</li>
<li>Independently deployable</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Infrastructure insertion: security, debugging, basic operations and management. And can do it in a way that has the deep context of the application.
</p>

<p>
Communicating: SOA in the past, didn't work, network, computers slower, passing around relatively large blobs of XML.
</p>

<p>
We now have this burgeoning growth of services where we nearly have a function coming up.

<ul>
<li>Independently replacable.</li>
<li>Independently upgradable.</li>

</ul>

<p>
In Monolithic, we do this by exchanging software libraries.
</p>

<p>
In Microservices, we decide to do this via independent services. 
</p>

<p>
Today, can spin up Docker containers for <i>seconds</i>. AWS Lambda: the service without the server.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Almost to the point of a service being in some cases a single person or small team. Turns out this works out ok: developers who want quiet weekends, don't push out new software on Fridays, etc. Self policing.

<h3 id="orga997d64">Security Implications</h3>
<p>
<b>With a monolith</b> - a security breach into the monolith one has access to the whole system. Can say anything to the database.
</p>

<p>
<b>With a microservces approach</b>, more agility:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can have some parts high-security risk and some low-risk.</li>
<li>Can innovate really quickly in user experience and personalization.</li>
<li>No need to have whole system with HIPAA compliance, most of app can be extremely agile and innovative.</li>
<li>Tight control over narrow attack surface.</li>

<h3 id="orgf20e988">Security Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Encrypt data in transit and at rest</li>
<li>Automate configuration and policy management</li>
<li>Segment and isolate applications and services</li>

</ol>

<p>
"The enemy knows the system" (Shannon)
</p>

<p>
Your security shouldn't <i>rely</i> on your architecture being hidden, but you don't need to expose it. (Kerckhoff's Principle)
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>Remember, what was once interprocess communication are now network calls. Keep certficates up to date, fix SSL issues, manage software versions well.</li>
<li>Complex functions across disparate systems lead to the most common error: human. Separating development and administrative roles and go long way to reduce errors.</li>
<li>Most will isolate dev from prod, but can also govern interactions between services.</li>

<h3 id="orgb1ee34e">Graham Lea's Questions (Core)</h3>
<ol>
<li>When your service is called, does it require the calling software to authenticate itself, or does it let anything connect?</li>
<li>Do your services let their callers access all the APIs that a service offers, or just the ones it needs to fulfil its function?</li>
<li>If an attacker owned a service, could they pretty easily request anything from its downstream services?</li>
<li>What guarantees do you have that a request received from an authenticated user hasn’t been tampered with?</li>
<li>How do you actively identify the private and sensitive data in your database?</li>
